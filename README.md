# **A to J with 7-Segment Display (Common Cathode) using AND-OR-NOT Gates**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project involves designing a logic circuit to display the characters **A to J** on a **7-segment display** using only **AND, OR, and NOT gates**. The implementation follows a structured approach involving truth table formulation, Karnaugh map (K-Map) simplification, logic circuit design, and simulation.  

## **Project Steps**  

1. **Truth Table Creation**  
   - Develop a truth table that maps the 4-bit binary input (0000 to 1001) to the corresponding **7-segment display outputs (a to g)**.  
   - Consider inputs from **1010 (decimal 10) to 1111 (decimal 15) as "Don't Care" conditions** for optimization.  

2. **Boolean Function Simplification**  
   - Use **K-Maps** to simplify Boolean equations for each segment.  

3. **Logic Circuit Design**  
   - Draw the logic circuit diagram based on the simplified Boolean expressions.  

4. **Simulation and Virtual Implementation**  
   - Implement and simulate the circuit using **TinkerCAD.com** or **Electronic Workbench**.  

5. **Real Hardware Implementation**  
   - Build the circuit on a real board using **logic gates (AND, OR, NOT)** and a **7-segment common cathode display**.  

## **Expected Output**  
- When a 4-bit binary input (0000 to 1001) is given, the corresponding letter **A to J** is displayed on the **7-segment display**.  
- Inputs from **1010 to 1111** are not required to display any specific character.
